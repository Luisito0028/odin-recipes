    <h1>Traditional Rice Puto</h1>
    <p>Rice cakes are the most popular snacks of rural folks here in the Philippines. It is commonly called puto in our Tagalog language</p>
    <p>When I was a child, the scenes were at early 70s, I used to witness the elders using the larger version of mortar (the lubang, usually rectangular, round or square with round interior) and pestle (the halo, usually longer), wherein several persons (two or three or more) can pound a newly-milled non-sticky rice into a white, powdery product (rice flour) in less than half an hour.</p>
    <p>It was usually one or two kilos of rice made into flour that can produce a hundred rice cakes through steaming it with a boiling kettle. The kettle's opening is usually secured with strips of banana trunk, binded into round steamer, where half of empty clean coconut shell will be used as the container for the rice cake mixture to be steamed.</p>
    <p>An ideal coconut shell cake mold should be three (3) inches in diameter.</p>
    <p>In just two to three minutes the mixture will be cooked by steaming.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: The kind of rice cake that is featured here is what we usually call as <strong>putong galapong</strong>,</p>
    <p>It doesn't have a calumet or baking powder content as flour riser, unlike other variations such as the multi-colored <strong>puto lanson</strong> (cassava flour), <strong>bibingka</strong>, 
        <strong>puto pandan</strong>(pandan flavour), <strong>puto ube</strong> (purple yam flavour), <strong>puto bumbong</strong>(purple rice steamed in bamboo tubes).</p>
